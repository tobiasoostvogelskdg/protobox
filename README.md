# Protobox 3Division Media
Hello and welcome to this repository!
Here you can find a school project from students of the Dutch Karel de Grote Hogeschool.

In this project we created a small wooden box with an arduino inside. 
This setup is meant to let users test 3 different sensors.

Feel free to make your own protobox and experiment with all the things you can come up with.
